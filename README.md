# Visitor Pattern
### Type
The Visitor Design Pattern is **a behavioral pattern**.
### Description
The visitor design pattern gives you the ability to *add new operations to existing object without modifying the existing objects*.
### Use
1. When you have an already working codebase, currently running on production.
2. When you want to add a function but it deviates from the primary goal.
### Prevent
1. From breaking the already working codebase because of a potential bug in your changes.
2. From making your code fragile and very time expensive to modify.
